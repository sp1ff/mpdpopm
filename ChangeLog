	Generalized commands.
	I removed the "scribbu" feature & associated commands & replaced
	it with a more-general feature in which 'mpdpopm' admins can
	define arbitrary server-side commands.

2020-10-07  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Update the "set-genre" sub-command.
	Change 'mppopm set-genre' to take arbitrary text rather than a
	numeric Winamp genre.

2020-10-06  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Work in progress.
	This commit:

	    1. removes the "send-to-playlist" command
	    2. fixes a bug by which a failure in message processing would
	       cause the daemon to exit

2020-09-19  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	More project hygiene:
	  - running `mppopmd' as a daemon now works
	  - improved the sticker API; it will now coerce caller-supplied
	    types to & from strings
	  - commands::spawn never needed to be async
	  - started building-out the test suite preparatory to more
	    re-factoring

2020-08-13  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	0.1.7 re-factor
	    - add database updates on command completion
	    - add unit tests
	    - general code hygiene

2020-05-25  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Added two new sub-commands & corresponding server-side implementations:
	    1. set-genre
	    2. set-xtag

2020-05-20  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Another massive re-factor.
	Getting closer to "thinking in Rust" (I think). Also implemented new
	commands:

	    1. setpc: set the playcount expplicitly (and run any associated
	       command on the server)
	    2. setlp: set the lastplayed timesetamp explicitly

2020-05-18  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Updates to the latest build.

	Massive re-factor:
	    - split the code into a daemon & a client
	    - moved the basic protocol behind a trait
	    - used that to implement unit tests
	    - cleaned up altogether

	Stop exiting when the player stops.
	This commit started off as an attempt to fix the handling of player
	state changes; `mpdpopm' was failing whenever the player was
	stopped. While doing so, I wound up re-writing large swaths
	of code. The current status is akin to having your computer
	disassembled on the living room floor; it boots up, but there are
	screws everywhere & disconnected cables on top of it all.

	Initial implementation of ratings & play counts.
	This is a very preliminary commit of ratings & play count
	implementations. I really just wanted to validate my approach;
	my Rust-fu is so lacking at this point I don't know if I
	can even push this :O

2020-04-08  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Fix typo in README.org.

	Initial commit of `mpdpopm'.
