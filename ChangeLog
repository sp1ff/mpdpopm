	Cutting release 0.3.2

2023-12-28  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Cutting release 0.3.2

	Assorted clean-up pre-merge:
	    - fix the project CI (again)
	    - I've decided on a policy of supporting rust versions going back
	      six months. At the time of this writing, that's rust 1.70.0.
	    - address a corner case when HOME isn not set
	    - update GNU files

	[#9] Correct the way quoting is done when sending commands.
	This commit will cause the client to properly quote string
	parameters in commands.

	[Issue #010] Repair setting a sticker for the first time.
	In MPD commit 432675d4c23450c527333ed4a29d13f843e001da the error
	message for "sticker get" when the sticker is not found was changed.
	mpdpopm (foolishly) relied on the error message. This patch changes
	the salient logic to examine only the error code, instead.

	Fix the nightly CI workflow.
	The `toml` crate recently made a release that no longer builds
	with Rust 1.65. This commit pins that crate along with a few
	of its dependencies to preserve the ability of this project
	to build on the "oldest supported" version of Rust.

2023-09-29  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	fix CI

2023-09-16  Michael Herstine  <michael@lithic>

	[CI] Fix the CI job.
	A number of dependencies no longer build under rust 1.65. I
	pinned 'em in order to preserve the minimum supported version.

	  - toml
	  - toml-edit
	  - cargo-deb
	  - anstyle to 1.0.2

2023-08-26  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Pinned a few clap dependencies in order to preserve the ability to build with rust 1.65

2023-08-25  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Update pinned rust toolchain version to 1.65 to accomodate a dependency

2023-07-22  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Update/fix the release workflow.
	The `release` workflow had gotten stale & naturally didn't work
	after long disuse.

2023-07-21  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	mpdpopm release 0.3.1.

2023-07-15  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Update the Continuous Integration job & upgrade Clap to v4.
	I suppose I conflated two changes in one commit. This patch:

	    - updated the CI job & got it working again
	    - upgraded to Clap v4
	    - updates README & NEWS accordingly

	Getting Clap v4. to *compile* was one thing-- the upgrade also
	required a broad revision of the use of the Clap API (substituting
	`get_flag()` for `contains_id()`, for instance.

2023-07-15  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Upgraded to tokio 1.0.

2023-07-15  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Remove Snafu.
	After some thought & some research, I decided I want to hand-craft
	my Errors. Thoughts here:

	<https://www.unwoundstack.com/blog/rust-error-handling.html>

	    - Snafu has been removed
	    - `cargo test` passes
	    - `cargo doc` builds cleanly

2022-01-24  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Commented out testing code in the release GHA

	Updated the pinned rust toolchain version to 1.56.1 because that's the first release to support the 2021 edition and cargo-deb now requires that

2021-10-11  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	working on release workflow

	Address issue #5.
	`mppopmd` can now communicate with the mpd server over a local
	(Unix) socket.

2021-03-29  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Repairing GH workflows

	Post rebase checkin.
	This commit updates some packaging details after I rebased
	the 'filters' branch onto 'master'.

2021-03-28  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Documentation commit.
	Broke-up the README; most of its content went into a new
	user manual in Texinfo format. The process of documenting
	filter quoting exposed multiple bugs-- fixed.

2021-03-28  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	First true filter implementation.
	This commit:

	    1. changes the grammar to use an enumeration for the LHS
	       of terms

	    2. adds 'searchadd' to the list of commands supported by
	       mppopmd

	    3. adds 'findadd' & 'searchadd' commands to 'mppopm'

	    4. begins adding unit tests for the evaluator

2021-03-28  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	First commit of filter evaluation logic.
	The filter evaluator is fully functional; method 'findadd' is
	working.

	Adding the `findadd' command.
	This commit implements first support for extending MPD filters
	to include items managed by mpdpopm.

	First commit of the filter parser. Contains just the grammar and some unit tests-- no externally-visible functionality.

2021-03-11  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Commented-out the automatic version release now that I've debugged the issue

	Fix release workflow.

	Fix release workflow.

2021-03-10  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Boilerplate update.
	This commit updates copyright statements throughout, as well
	as a few typos.

2021-03-09  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Clear-up some packaging issues.
	This commit:

	    1. addresses issue #3 by providing an Arch package with
	       releases
	    2. addresses issue #4 by providing a systemd unit

2020-12-19  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Commenting out the hard-coded release number in release.yml.

2020-12-17  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Fixing-up release workflow

	Address issue #2.
	This commit contains no new code or features; rather it is a
	significant re-work to the user docs (i.e. README.org) along
	with the provision of pre-built binaries & a Debian binary
	package.

2020-11-24  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Hopefully, my final workflow commit.
	    1. Re-comment the version
	    2. Change the build-release job to only upload source Autotools
	       distros for Ubuntu

	Hard-coding the release version preparatory to forcing a release.

	Updated the README with up-to-date installation instructions.

	Adding a release workflow.

2020-11-22  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Committing my first GitHub Actions workflow

2020-11-18  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Bugfix for issue #1.

2020-10-22  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Preparing for publication to crates.io.

	Generalized commands.
	I removed the "scribbu" feature & associated commands & replaced
	it with a more-general feature in which 'mpdpopm' admins can
	define arbitrary server-side commands.

2020-10-07  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Update the "set-genre" sub-command.
	Change 'mppopm set-genre' to take arbitrary text rather than a
	numeric Winamp genre.

2020-10-06  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Work in progress.
	This commit:

	    1. removes the "send-to-playlist" command
	    2. fixes a bug by which a failure in message processing would
	       cause the daemon to exit

2020-09-19  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	More project hygiene:
	  - running `mppopmd' as a daemon now works
	  - improved the sticker API; it will now coerce caller-supplied
	    types to & from strings
	  - commands::spawn never needed to be async
	  - started building-out the test suite preparatory to more
	    re-factoring

2020-08-13  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	0.1.7 re-factor
	    - add database updates on command completion
	    - add unit tests
	    - general code hygiene

2020-05-25  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Added two new sub-commands & corresponding server-side implementations:
	    1. set-genre
	    2. set-xtag

2020-05-20  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Another massive re-factor.
	Getting closer to "thinking in Rust" (I think). Also implemented new
	commands:

	    1. setpc: set the playcount expplicitly (and run any associated
	       command on the server)
	    2. setlp: set the lastplayed timesetamp explicitly

2020-05-18  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Updates to the latest build.

	Massive re-factor:
	    - split the code into a daemon & a client
	    - moved the basic protocol behind a trait
	    - used that to implement unit tests
	    - cleaned up altogether

2020-04-19  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Stop exiting when the player stops.
	This commit started off as an attempt to fix the handling of player
	state changes; `mpdpopm' was failing whenever the player was
	stopped. While doing so, I wound up re-writing large swaths
	of code. The current status is akin to having your computer
	disassembled on the living room floor; it boots up, but there are
	screws everywhere & disconnected cables on top of it all.

2020-04-12  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Initial implementation of ratings & play counts.
	This is a very preliminary commit of ratings & play count
	implementations. I really just wanted to validate my approach;
	my Rust-fu is so lacking at this point I don't know if I
	can even push this :O

2020-04-08  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Fix typo in README.org.

	Initial commit of `mpdpopm'.
