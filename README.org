* Introduction

=mpdpopm= provides a companion daemon to [[https://www.musicpd.org/][mpd]] for maintaining play counts, ratings and last-played timestamps, along with an associated CLI for talking to the daemon. Similar to [[https://github.com/vincent-petithory/mpdfav][mpdfav]], but written in Rust (which I prefer to Go), it will maintain this information in your sticker database. Along the lines of [[https://alip.github.io/mpdcron][mpdcron]], it will also allow you to keep that information up-to-date in your tags by invoking external (user-provided & -configured) commands.

* Prerequisites

  - [[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install][Rust]]: Rust is a memory- & thread-safe language with no runtime or garbage collector
  - [[https://www.musicpd.org/][Music Player Daemon]]: "Music Player Daemon (MPD) is a flexible, powerful, server-side application for playing music. Through plugins and libraries it can play a variety of sound files while being controlled by its network protocol."

* Installing

While I plan on publishing this to [[https://crates.io/][crates.io]], I have not yet done so. You can get a source tarball & install it through the usual =configure && make && make install= incantations.

* Getting Started

** Program Structure

[[https://github.com/sp1ff/mpdpopm][mpdpopm]] provides two programs:

  1. =mppopmd= is the companion daemon process
  2. =mppopm= is the associated command-line interface to the daemon

I still haven't provided a =systemd= service unit, so you'll have to run the daemon process manually (say =mppopmd --help= for the relevant options; you may want to run it in the foreground while you get it up & running). Once up, it will create an [[https://www.musicpd.org/][mpd]] channel for commands ("unwoundstack.com:commands" by default, but this is configurable) and begin monitoring [[https://www.musicpd.org/][mpd]] playback. Every time [[https://www.musicpd.org/][mpd]] plays a track, it will increment that track's playcount & last-played timestamp in the sticker database. If any [[https://www.musicpd.org/][mpd]] client sends the "rating" command to our channel, [[https://github.com/sp1ff/mpdpopm][mpdpopm]] will also update the corresponding sticker.

Of particular interest is the fact that the user can configure commands to be run when the playcount is updated or the rating is set. You might, for instance, use this feature to update the =PCNT= and/or =POPM= tags accordingly.

=mppopm= is a simple CLI that will let you get & set playcounts & ratings.

** Configuration

=mppopmd= takes an optional configuration file. I haven't documented it fully yet-- here is mine:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ((log . "/home/mgh/var/log/mppopmd.log")
   (host . "192.168.1.6")
   (port . 6600)
   (local_music_dir . "/mnt/Took-Hall/mp3")
   (playcount_sticker . "unwoundstack.com:playcount")
   (lastplayed_sticker . "unwoundstack.com:lastplayed")
   (played_thresh . 0.6)
   (poll_interval_ms . 5000)
   (playcount_command . "/home/mgh/bin/scribbu")
   (playcount_command_args . ("popm" "-a" "-A" "-b" "-o" "sp1ff@pobox.com" "-C" "%playcount" "%full-file"))
   (commands_chan . "unwoundstack.com:commands")
   (rating_sticker . "unwoundstack.com:rating")
   (ratings_command . "/home/mgh/bin/scribbu")
   (ratings_command_args . ("popm" "-a" "-A" "-b" "-o" "sp1ff@pobox.com" "-r" "%rating" "%full-file")))
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Generalized Commands

The admin can also configure arbitrary commands to be run server-side in response to messages received on the mpdpopm command channel. As an example, an entry in the configuration file like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (gen_cmds .
          (((name . "set-genre")
            (formal_parameters . (Literal Track))
            (default_after . 1)
            (cmd . "/home/mgh/bin/scribbu")
            (args . ("genre" "-a" "-C" "-g" "%1" "%full-file"))
            (update . TrackOnly)))
#+END_EXAMPLE

will define a new command "set-genre", with two parameters, the second of which can be omitted (it will default to the current track). When mpdpopm receives this command (i.e. when a client says something like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  sendmessage unwoundstack.com:commands "set-genre Rock"
#+END_EXAMPLE

mpdpopm will invoke =/home/mgh/bin/scribbu= like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  /home/user/bin/mgh/scribbu genre -a -C  -g Rock "${music-dir}/${song URI}"
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Status & Roadmap

I am currently using [[https://github.com/sp1ff/mpdpopm][mpdpopm]] day in & day out, but this is still work-in-progress. I have chosen the version number (0.1) in the hopes of indicating that. Suggestions, bugs & PRs welcome!
